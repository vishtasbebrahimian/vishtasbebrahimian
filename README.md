# Hello People

## Getting started

This is an idea actually and i like to write about it, maybe some others helping me to make it true. 
#### anyway, what's the idea? 
imagine a whole planet. everyone has a **google account** had a place in this planet. 
i open a browser or put my 3d eyeglass in my eyes and in the search bar i write **google planet**

a planet showing up before my eyes. when i sign in with my google account, spining and going down in the planet. eventually i stop in front of a place that can be an everywhere you choose in account setting, everywhere i mean that it has a view of mountain, jungle or ocean etc

after that i must build this place for my self. 

### it's my home
but actually my 3d home in metaverse. i can have a *library room*, *video room*, *conference room* and etc that i access my all data in every one of this rooms. 

I can go to photo room and see my photos on the wall.

I can go to library room, every document i have in my *Google Drive*, it's in the shelfÙˆ I pick up one of them and sit at the table and start reading. my worksheets on the wall, i select one of them and start editting 

i can go to work remotely and collaborate with others in my office. 

## the point is i am in the  **simulator world**.
